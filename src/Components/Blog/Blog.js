            <h1>Difference between javascript and nodejs</h1>
            <p>	Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website. <br />
                NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment. </p>
            <p>Javascript is basically used on the client-side. <br />	Node is mostly used on the server-side.</p>
            <p>	Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox. <br /> V8 is the Javascript engine inside of node.js that parses and runs Javascript. </p>

            <h2>Differences between SQL and NoSQL</h2>
            <p>SQL database is tables with fixed rows and columns. <br />
                NoSQL database= Document: JSON documents, Key-value: key-value pairs, Wide-column: tables with rows and dynamic columns, Graph: nodes and edges</p>
            <p>SQL is Typically required <br /> No Sql is  Typically not required  </p>
            <p>SQL is Requires ORM (object-relational mapping). <br />
                Many do not require ORMs. MongoDB documents map directly to data structures in most popular programming languages.

            <h2>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h2>
            <p>
                In short, JWTs are used as a secure way to authenticate users and share information.

                Typically, a private key, or secret, is used by the issuer to sign the JWT. The receiver of the JWT will verify the signature to ensure that the token hasnâ€™t been altered after it was signed by the issuer. It is difficult for unauthenticated sources to guess the signing key and attempt to change the claims within the JWT.</p>
            <p>JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

                A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.</p>
